# Project Title:

An Implementation of Data Structures And Algorithms In Python

## 1. Project Description:

This repository contains an implementation of various Data Structures and Algorithms using Python programming language, 
adapted from a course on Udemy.

## 2. Installation:

i. Clone the git repo

```
https://github.com/AAdewunmi/DataStructures-And-Algorithms-In-Python.git
```

ii. Open project folder

iii. Explore

ðŸ˜Ž

## 3. How to Use:

You can choose to run individual Python files in your preferred IDE or buy the course that accompanies the code base so you 
can follow along with visualisations of Binary Search Trees and Graphs etc.

## 4. Contributing:

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
