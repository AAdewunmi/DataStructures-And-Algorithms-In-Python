# A file is a container in computer storage devices used for storing data.
# When we want to read from or write to a file, we need to open it first.
# When we are done, it needs to be closed so that the resources that are tied with the file are freed.
# Hence, in Python, a file operation takes place in the following order:
#     Open a file
#     Read or write (perform operation)
#     Close the file
