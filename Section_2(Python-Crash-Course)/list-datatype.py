# List Definition: A list is a collection of similar types of data. It has the following characteristics:
# List items are ordered, changable, and allow duplicate values.
# List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc

# (1) Create a Python List
# A list is created in Python by placing items inside [], separated by commas . For example,
# A list with 3 integers
numbers = [1, 2, 5]
print(numbers)
# Output: [1, 2, 5]

# A list can have any number of items, and they may be of different types (integer, float, string, etc.). For example,
# empty list
my_list = []
# list with mixed data types
my_list = [1, "Hello", 3.4]

# (2) Access Python List Elements
# In Python, each item in a list is associated with a number. The number is known as a list index.
# We can access elements of an array using the index number (0, 1, 2 â€¦). For example,

languages = ["Python", "Swift", "C++"]
# access item at index 0
print(languages[0])   # Python
# access item at index 2
print(languages[2])   # C++

# (3) Negative Indexing in Python
# (4) Slicing of a Python List
# (5) Add Elements to a Python List
# (6) Remove an Item From a List
# (7) Iterating through a List
# (8) Check if an Item Exists in the Python List
