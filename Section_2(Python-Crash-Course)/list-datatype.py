# List Definition: A list is a collection of similar types of data. It has the following characteristics:
# List items are ordered, changable, and allow duplicate values.
# List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc

# (1) Create a Python List
# A list is created in Python by placing items inside [], separated by commas . For example,
# A list with 3 integers
numbers = [1, 2, 5]
print(numbers)
# Output: [1, 2, 5]

# A list can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string, etc.). For example,
# empty list
my_list = []
# list with mixed data types
my_list = [1, "Hello", 3.4]

# (2) Access Python List Elements
# (3) Negative Indexing in Python
# (4) Slicing of a Python List
# (5) Add Elements to a Python List
# (6) Remove an Item From a List
# (7) Iterating through a List
# (8) Check if an Item Exists in the Python List
