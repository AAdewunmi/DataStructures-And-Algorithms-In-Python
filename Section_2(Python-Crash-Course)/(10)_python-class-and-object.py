# Python is a versatile programming language that supports various programming styles,
# including object-oriented programming (OOP) through the use of classes and objects.

# (1) Python Classes
# We use the class keyword to create a class in Python. For example,
class Bike:
    name = ""
    gear = 0

# (2) Python Objects
# An object is called an instance of a class. For example, suppose Bike is a class then we can create objects like bike1, bike2, etc. from the class.
# Here's the syntax to create an object.
# create class
class Bike:
    name = ""
    gear = 0
# create objects of class
bike1 = Bike()
bike2 = Bike()

# (3) Access Class Attributes Using Objects
# (4) Create Multiple Objects of Python Class
# (5) Python Methods
# (6) Python Constructors
# (7) Python Inheritance
# (8) Python Encapsulation
# (9) Python Polymorphism
