# Set Definition: Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. It has the following characteristics:
# Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.

# Create a Set in Python
# In Python, we create sets by placing all the elements inside curly braces {}, separated by comma.
# A set can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, tuple, string etc.). But a set cannot have mutable elements like lists, sets or dictionaries as its elements.
# Let's see an example,
# create a set of integer type
student_id = {112, 114, 116, 118, 115}
print('Student ID:', student_id)
# create a set of string type
vowel_letters = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
print('Vowel Letters:', vowel_letters)
# create a set of mixed data types
mixed_set = {'Hello', 101, -2, 'Bye'}
print('Set of mixed data types:', mixed_set)
