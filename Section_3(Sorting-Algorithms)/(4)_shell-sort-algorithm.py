# Shell Sort Algorithm
# ========================
# Definition:
# Shell sort is a generalised version of the insertion sort algorithm.
# It first sorts elements that are far apart from each other and successively
# reduces the interval between the elements to be sorted.
#
# Shell Sort Complexity
# Î˜(N(log N))
#
# Shell Sort Algorithm
# Algorithm shell-sort(A)
#   n = length(A)
#   for gap = n/2, gap>0, gap = gap/2
#       for i=gap, i<n, i++
#           gvalue = A[i]
#           j = i - gap
#           while j >= 0 and A[j] > gvalue
#                A[j + gap] = A[j]
#                j = j - gap
#            A[j + gap] = gvalue
